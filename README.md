# CKDPlanDesigner

CKDPlanDesigner is a package used to automatically design custom care plans for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It leverages physicological and demographic information contained in patients' electronic health records to assign sets of evidence-based interventions that aim to improve disease prognosis and reduce costs. *Note: this was implemented as a final project for BMI 210 / CS 270 at Stanford, and it is not approved for clinical use*

- A notebook illustrating basic functionality of the package is found in `CKD_tutorial.ipynb.`
- Source code exists in `project_code/src/CKDPlanDesigner`
- The package is pip installable by calling `pip install -e project_code/`
