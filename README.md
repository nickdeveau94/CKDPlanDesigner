# CKDPlanDesigner

CKDPlanDesigner is a package used to automatically design custom care plans for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It uses physicological and demographic information contained in patients' electronic health records to assign sets of evidence-based interventions that aim to improve disease prognosis and reduce costs.

A notebook illustrating basic functionality of the package is found in CKD_tutorial.ipynb.
